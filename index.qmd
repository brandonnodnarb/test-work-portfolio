Hello, I’m **Barbara McClintock**, an American cytogeneticist fascinated by the dynamic nature of the genome.  
My work with **maize chromosomes** led to the discovery of genetic recombination, chromosome breakage, and eventually, **transposable elements** — genes that can move within the genome.

I completed my PhD in Botany at **Cornell University** in 1927, and spent much of my career exploring how chromosomes behave and control genetic expression in maize.  
In 1983, I was awarded the **Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** for the discovery of genetic transposition.

This site serves as a portfolio of my research, publications, and ongoing scientific interests.
